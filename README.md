**Agile Auto Parts (AAP) DevOps Transformation Repository**

Introduction:
Agile Auto Parts (AAP) is a prominent global auto parts retailer that has experienced steady growth over the past two decades. However, since 2005, a decline in revenues has raised concerns among the board, prompting them to investigate and take decisive actions to restore growth. The board has pinpointed the IT department and services as the primary suspect behind the declining performance. Several board members have heard about the transformative impact of DevOps in helping rival companies drastically improve their Time-to-Market (TTM). As a result, the board is open to embracing DevOps but seeks specific insights and recommendations to assess the pros and cons of this approach.

Context:
AAP operates across 36 countries, managing 452 stores and employing nearly 6800 personnel, including staff, salespeople, and other personnel. The company also maintains continuous communication with over 60 diverse partners, including auto makers, parts manufacturers, and other retailers. Despite reporting 136 million EUR in revenues worldwide in 2018, AAP's market position has slipped, leading to discontent among shareholders. Once a market leader, AAP now lags behind its main competitors. Notably, the Time-to-Market is alarmingly poor, to the extent that AAP refrains from disclosing this information.

Identifying the Issue:
After an in-depth examination, the board has identified the root cause of the problemâ€”the information system. AAP's IT department has been in operation since the company's inception, with just two developers initially coding the entire system. However, over time, the situation has dramatically changed, putting tremendous strain on the information system's capacity to keep up with the company's growth and the evolving market demands.

The Target:
The board's primary objective is clear: AAP must reach and maintain a Time-to-Market that outperforms its competitors. To achieve this goal, DevOps has emerged as a promising solution. By embracing DevOps principles and practices, AAP aims to enhance collaboration, streamline processes, automate workflows, and foster continuous integration and delivery. The successful implementation of DevOps can significantly improve AAP's efficiency, shorten development cycles, and boost customer satisfaction.

Repository Contents:

Strategy Roadmap Document:
This comprehensive document outlines AAP's existing information system, providing a detailed blueprint of the current resources, processes, and locations. The roadmap then envisions the target solution with a DevOps-centric architecture, incorporating the proposed prototype's description. Additionally, this document elucidates the DevOps tools and technologies recommended for AAP's transformation, including version control systems, automated testing frameworks, containerization platforms, and monitoring solutions.

Addressing Main Concerns:
This section addresses the board's primary concerns, emphasizing how DevOps can effectively tackle the identified issues. From strengthening the information system to surpassing competitors' Time-to-Market and regaining market leadership, each concern is thoroughly analyzed and aligned with the DevOps transformation strategy.

Proof of Concept (POC):
The repository includes a Proof of Concept (POC) that exemplifies our proficiency in implementing a robust delivery pipeline. The POC employs a selected application to demonstrate the efficacy of DevOps principles in enhancing efficiency and collaboration. The provided information enables AAP to recreate the pipeline and run base cases independently, further illustrating the potential benefits of DevOps adoption.

We invite you to explore this repository to gain a comprehensive understanding of our proposed DevOps transformation strategy for Agile Auto Parts. Together, we can revitalize AAP's growth trajectory, accelerate Time-to-Market, and reclaim our position as a market leader in the global auto parts industry.
